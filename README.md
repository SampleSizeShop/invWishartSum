The invWishartSum Package
=========================

The invWishartSum package for R (>3.0.0) implements an approximation to the
distribution of a sum of inverse Wishart random matrices.  

The package provides companion code for the manuscript:

Kreidler, S. M., Muller, K. E., & Glueck, D. H. An Approximation to 
the Distribution of the Sum of Inverse Wishart Matrices, In review.

To replicate the results in the manuscript
1. Download the zip file from https://github.com/samplesizeshop/invWishartSum
2. Install the package into your local R installation (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Add_002don-packages)
3. load the library: 
  
  > library(invWishartSum)

4. Run the simulation study (takes about 1 hour to run)

  > runSimulationStudy(study.data.dir="myDataDir", study.figures.dir="myFiguresDir")
