Title: An approximation to the distribution of inverse Wishart sums
Author: Sarah M. Kreidler

Suggests: MASS
Description: Functions to calculate an inverse central Wishart to 
  approximate the distribution of a sum of inverse central Wishart 
  matrices and sums of certain quadratic forms in inverse central 
  Wishart matrices.  The package includes functions to evaluate 
  the approximation graphically, and by using the energy distance 
  described by Szekely and Rizzo. The package includes all supporting 
  code to produce the results of the manuscript "An Approximation 
  to the Distribution of the Sum of Inverse Wishart Matrices" 
  by Kreidler et. al. (currently in review)
